# Updating-Reference-Architectures-with-EC2-Instance-Connect-Endpoint
To update the existing reference architectures to include the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint. This endpoint will establish secure connections to resources in the private subnets. The goal is to create two high-level AWS infrastructure diagrams demonstrating deploying a highly available application using both EC2 instances and AWS Fargate

To fulfill your requirements, I'll proceed with the following steps:

Review the Draw IO tool at the provided link.
Follow the tutorial in the YouTube video to familiarize myself with the tool.
Access the existing reference architectures to understand their structure and components.
Incorporate the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint into the reference architectures.
Create two high-level AWS infrastructure diagrams: one demonstrating the deployment of a highly available application using EC2 instances, and the other demonstrating the deployment of a highly available application using AWS Fargate.
Ensure the diagrams are clear, organized, and labeled following AWS architecture best practices.
Update the reference architectures with the newly created diagrams, ensuring they accurately reflect the proposed changes.
